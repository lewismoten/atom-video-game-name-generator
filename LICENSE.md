website:

If you'd like to use the VGNG on your website, feel free! If you want to make
your own version (or make a better one for me ;) ), the wordlist is called
video_game_names.txt, and the syntax should be simple enough to figure out
(three wordlists separated by dashes, with dupe protection listed after the
"^" and separated by pipes "|".) I only ask that, if you copy the VGNG for
your site, please don't use it for any profit-generating purpose (charging
for it or selling ads), and include a link back to this site.
